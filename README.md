# Introduction

I`ve built one more block of my e-commece application, at the end all these smalls pieces are going to feet together to provide my e-commerce experience

The main focus in this project was to practice a little of designing thinking and how to apply that in the front-end development. To achieve this goal I first thought about how I`d like the form to look like and then I made a draft using Figma to play a little with the colors and spaces.

Finally I tried to bring this layout to reality, using React and Bootstrap for a responsive design

## Reflection

Building this project I came to the conclusion that when we are thinking about an application, several idead pop up from our mind, but as we lack practical experience is very hard to measure the complexity and the amount of time needed to building something up


## Designing

This time I decided to try something different, before coding I enrolled in a Figma crash course and then I designed my layout before coding the whole interface
